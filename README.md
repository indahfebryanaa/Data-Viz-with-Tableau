# Data-Viz-with-Tableau
This repository contains the analysis and visualizations I have created in Tableau about the Global Superstore dataset.

## About
The Global Superstore dataset is a dataset that contains sales of office supplies, furniture and technology stuffs from a global retail chain.

## Dataset
The Global Superstore dataset contains 51,291 rows of data with 24 columns, which are Row ID, Order ID, Order Date, Ship Date, Ship Mode, Customer ID, Customer Name, Segment, City, State, Country, Postal Code, Market, Region, Product ID, Category, Sub-Category, Product Name, Sales Quantity, Discount, Profit, Shipping, Cost, and Order Priority

## Summary
In my Tableau dashboard and story visualization, I have done exploration on the relationship between the profit and orders in the year 2011 - 2014, learns about the shipping cost in every country by product's category per year (2011 - 2014). And then, I also have learnt about the relationship between sales and return in the company and how is the condition about the company. The last one is about the relationship about the sales trend, profit, discount, and the shipping cost. In every visualization, I have done the analysis by making questions, for example is "How can every column be connected?", "How is the company condition?", and "What is the problem?"
